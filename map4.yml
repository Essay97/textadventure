      You are on a path that hopefully leads to the Iron Mountain peak.

      The terrain has a strange shade of yellow and it's covered of blue
      stones.

      To the north, you see a big black forest.

      To the south, your warm house.

      To the east, there is the road for the port.

      You suddenly feel that the temperature is dropping quickly.

      You entered a big forest: everything is dark and cold, you can barely see
      your feet.

      All around you, there are only trees and it seems like there is a small
      clearing to the west.

      Oh, this is your happy place. You live here with your wife and your 3

      The house faces the north road: it leads to a mountain footpath.

      You are walking down the main road that leads to the port. You have always
      been a little frightened by this road, you never really loved the sea.

      But this time, you see something that catches your attention: a knife in
      the middle of the road.
